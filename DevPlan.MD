### Design Principles
- Modern yet reverent
- Professional yet welcoming
- Clean and uncluttered
- Accessible and readable
- Consistent across platforms
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive and adaptive layouts
- Intuitive navigation patterns
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Thoughtful use of white space

### Component Design System
- Consistent spacing system (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl)
- Standardized border radius (sm, md, lg, xl, round)
- Layered shadow system (light, medium, dark)
- Responsive layout breakpoints
- Animation durations and easing curves
- Interactive state styles (hover, active, disabled)
- Loading and error states
- Empty states and placeholders

## Visual Design Considerations

Use color wheel theory to pick suitable color schemes.

This palette balances seriousness with warmth, creating an environment that feels both trustworthy and welcoming. The colors work well together to create visual hierarchy and guide users through the interface.

## Testing Strategy

For each phase, implement the following testing approach:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components
3. **UI Testing**: Verify UI renders correctly and is responsive
4. **User Testing**: Get feedback from actual users

**Use Jest and React Native Testing Library for automated tests. Create test scripts that can be run before each merge to ensure quality.

## Project Overview

- Secure user authentication
- Profile management
- Role-based access control
- Chat functionality for various ministry groups
